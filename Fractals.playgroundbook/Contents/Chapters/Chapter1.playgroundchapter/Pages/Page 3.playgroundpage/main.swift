 # ðŸŽ¥ More Fractals
 ![img](Sierpinski.png)
 It's time for you to see some more fractals in action! I have some really juicy ones â€“ it's definitely worth it.
 The first one is the *SierpiÅ„ski triangle*; you may have already heard of it. Just **run the code** to see it in action.

 - Note:
 Remember that the fractals are most impressive when shown in **fullscreen mode!**

/*:
 Wasn't that nice?
 In case you want to know how it's generated, see the code at the bottom. But first, **try out the two remaining fractals!**

//: The dragon is generated with a 90Â° angle. It's really fun to mess around with the angle; especially values between 45Â° and 90Â° give really interesting results!

 ### Example Code
 This is the code for the SierpiÅ„ski triangle from before â€“ just in case you were wondering.
 Go to the [next page](@next) to see some plants!

```
sierpinski = LSystem(
    startString: "A",
    productionRules: [
        "A" ~> "B-A-B",
        "B" ~> "A+B+A"
    ],
    drawingRules: [
        "A": .draw,
        "B": .draw,
        "-": .turnRight(angle: 60),
        "+": .turnLeft(angle: 60)
    ]
)
```
