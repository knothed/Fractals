 # ðŸŒ± Plants & Trees
 Now we come to the *video games* part. Well, we already have â€“ you've seen L-Systems, and this is *exactly* what plants use.

 Because plants are more complex than the fractals we've seen before, we need to introduce some more drawing rules. For example, `.saveState` and `.restoreState`, which save or restore the current **drawing state** (i.e. the arrow position and its direction) onto or from a stack.

 This allows us to generate simple plants and trees. Look at the following four plants (by **running the code**) and see how you like them!

/*:
 Of course, they do not yet look like realistic plants or trees, which is because they're 2-dimensional. L-Systems also provide a way to draw 3-dimensional fractals. Therefore, we add rules to *rotate around different axes* in the 3D coordinate system.

 Generating actual 3-dimensional plants is far beyond the scope (and time limit) of this playground. But, video games **do** actually use L-Systems under the hood for generating them â€“ just more complex ones than the ones having been showcased here.

 ### Example Plant
 Here you see the code for one of these plants (`Plants.weed`). It is still really simple â€“ there are plants with **way** more complex L-Systems!

 Go to the [next page](@next) to finish this playground.
 ```
 weed = LSystem(
     startString: "X",
     productionRules: [
         "F" ~> "FF",
         "X" ~> "F[+X]F[-X]+X"
     ],
     drawingRules: [
         "F": .draw,
         "X": .draw,
         "-": .turnLeft(angle: 25),
         "+": .turnRight(angle: 25),
         "[": .saveState,
         "]": .restoreState
     ]
 )
